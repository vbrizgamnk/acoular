Getting Started
===============

The beamfpy library is based on the Python programming language. While a basic knowledge of Python is definitely helpful, the following first step do require this. A number of good Python tutorials can be found on the web. 

This getting started tutorial assumes that the beamfpy library is installed together with its dependencies.

One possible way to use the library is for doing classic delay-and-sum beamforming. This can either be done either directly in the time domain or in the frequency domain. To get started with beamfpy, we will do a very basic example of beamforming in the frequency domain. In order to do such an analysis we do need some data to work on. In a practical application, this data is acquired during multichannel measurements using a microphone array. The library does provide some functionality to do so and store the measured sound pressure time histories for all channels of the microphone array in a hierarchical data file (HDF5) format. However, to do so a working measurement set-up is required. Thus, we will use simulated data here. Because the data file to be used is quite large (>10MB), we will generate it by running a python script (three_sources.py) that is contained in the 'examples' folder.

>>> python three_sources.py
 
As a result, the examples folder will contain a file 'three_sources.h5' that is 13MB large and contains the time history data for 64 microphone channels that are sampled at 51200 Hz for a duration of 1 seconds, i.e. 51200 samples per channel. The simulation is also done using the library using its simulation capabilities (see the reference).

The simulation generates the sound pressure at 64 microphones that are
arranged in the 'array64' geometry which is part of the library.

The sound field of three sources is simulated that are assumed to have incoherent signals. The source locations (relative to array center) and levels are given in the following table:

====== =============== ======
Source Location        Level 
====== =============== ======
1      (-0.1,-0.1,0.3) 1 Pa
2      (0.15,0,0.3)    0.7 Pa 
3      (0,0.1,0.3)     0.5 Pa

In what follows, it assumed that an interactive python session is started, preferably an IPython session:

>>> ipython

Then, the first step do an analysis is to import the beamfpy library:

>>> import beamfpy

This makes all the functionality available that we will need to do the beamforming analysis. We start with making the data from the HDF5 file available and create and instance of TimeSamples :

>>> ts = beamfpy.TimeSamples( name='three_sources.h5' )

The ts object now provides access to the HDF5 file and information stored in it. It is important to note that the data in the file is not read into the memory because it could be very large (i.e. several GB). Instead, the data is read in small chunks the moment it is needed. Because this is done automatically, the user does not have to take care of that.

The beamforming shall be done in the frequency domain. In this case the cross spectral matrix is the basis. This matrix consists of the cross power spectra of all possible combinations of channels. Here, this gives 64Â²=4096 cross power spectra. These spectra are computed using Welchs method, i.e. blocks of samples are taken from the signals and fourier-transformed using FFT, used to calculate the power spectra and then the results are averaged over a number of blocks. The blocks have a certain length and may be overlapping. In addition, a windowing function may be applied to each block prior to the FFT. To provide the facilities to calculate the cross spectral matrix we create an instance of PowerSpectra and define the size of the blocks to be 128 samples and a von Hann ('Hanning') window to be used:  

>>> ps = beamfpy.PowerSpectra( time_data=ts, block_size=128, window='Hanning' )

The data for the calculation is to be taken from the ts object that was created before. Because the calculation of the cross spectral matrix is a time consuming process, no calculation is performed at the moment, but is delayed until the result is actually needed. This concept of "lazy evaluation" is applied wherever possible throughout the library. This prevents unnecessary time-consuming computations. Another option to set the parameters for the Welch method would have been to first create a 'blank' or 'default' PowerSpectra object and set the parameters, or traits of the object, afterwards:

>>> ps = beamfpy.PowerSpectra()
>>> ps.time_data = ts
>>> ps.block_size = 128
>>> ps.window='Hanning'

If one (or more) parameters are changed, after the cross spectral matrix was calculated, then it we be recalculated the next time it is needed.

The beamforming will be done here in order to produce a mapping of the sound sources. Because such a map can be produced only when having a number of possible source positions available, these positions must be provided by creating a Grid object. More specifically, we want to create a RectGrid object that provides possible source positions in a regular, twodimensional grid with rectangular shape:

>>> rg = beamfpy.RectGrid( x_min=-0.2, x_max=0.2, y_min=-0.2, y_max=0.2, z=0.3, increment=0.01 )

The traits here give the dimensions of the grid and distance (increment) between individual source positions.


>>> mg = beamfpy.MicGeom( from_file=micgeofile )
>>> bb = beamfpy.BeamformerBase( freq_data=ps, grid=rg, mpos=mg )
