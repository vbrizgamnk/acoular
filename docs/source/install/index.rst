Installation
============

Requirements
------------

In order to install Acoular you need a Python 2.7 environment running on your machine. 
Furthermore, the Acoular module needs for the NumPy, SciPy, Traits, scikit-learn, 
pytables, and Chaco packages to be installed.

If you don't yet have Python installed on your computer, 
the `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ 
distribution might provide a good way to set up a fresh 
installation which brings with it most of the needed packages.
