"""
The acoular library: several classes for the implemetation of 
acoustic beamforming

A minimal usage example would be:

>>>    m = MicGeom(from_file='mic_geom.xml')
>>>    g = RectGrid(x_min=-0.8, x_max=-0.2, y_min=-0.1, y_max=0.3, z=0.8,\
 increment=0.01)
>>>    t1 = TimeSamples(name='measured_data.h5')
>>>   cal = Calib(from_file='calibration_data.xml')
>>>    f1 = EigSpectra(time_data=t1, block_size=256, window="Hanning",\
 overlap='75%', calib=cal)
>>>    e1 = BeamformerBase(freq_data=f1, grid=g, mpos=m, r_diag=False)
>>>    fr = 4000
>>>    L1 = L_p(e1.synthetic(fr, 0))

The classes in the module possess a number of automatic data update
capabilities. That is, only the traits must be set to get the results.
The calculation need not be triggered explictely.

The classes are also GUI-aware, they know how to display a graphical user
interface. So by calling

>>>    object_name.configure_traits()

on object "object_name" the relevant traits of each instance object may
be edited graphically.

The traits could also be set explicitely in the program, either in the
constructor of an object:

>>>    m = MicGeom(from_file='mic_geom.xml')

or at a later time

>>>    m.from_file = 'another_mic_geom.xml'

where all objects that depend upon the specific trait will update their
output if necessary.
